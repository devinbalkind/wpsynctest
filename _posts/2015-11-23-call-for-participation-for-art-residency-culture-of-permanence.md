    <strong>A thematic residency around the questions of communal shareholding and knowledge build-up at Arc, in Romainmôtier, Switzerland.In the second decade of the 21st century the neoliberal model is in crisis: we live in a society where 30 to 40 % of the population are knowledge workers within a system that is speculative and expresses the value of social collaboration in a way that does not fit. That leads us to imagining an exodus to a new prototype: we have to create new values and develop new ways of collaborating. Until now philosophers have imagined a different world with various kinds of theories, but how can we actually change it?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One possibility of relational dynamics is the peer-to-peer one, which is a form of communal shareholding: people can contribute to a group project in a horizontal way and can benefit from the results of the collective work, without direct individual reciprocity. Peer-to-peer is about building up a system through contribution from different points of view, by confronting different disciplines with each other, in a community of practice around a mutual goal. Transdisciplinarity starts from the objective, not from a single discipline. The question is rather: who has the best methods or techniques to better understand the objective.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By bringing together practitioners from different fields during a week in April 2016, Arc would like to explore how artistic strategies can be used to address wide-ranging issues related to peer-production and knowledge building.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The common objective during the week will be to develop a vegetable garden at Arc. By orienting ourselves towards permaculture – or ‘culture of permanence’ – we want to look at the link between the historical, social and biological settlement (abbey garden, farmer garden, ecosystem) and a new project. Can the development of a vegetable garden contribute to novel articulations about object oriented sociality: collaborating towards a mutual goal, according to the principles of anticredentialism (you don’t need references or degrees to do a specific task well) and equipotential (everyone has the same potential to contribute to a collective project with their specific talent or project)? What are the social innovations? And how can peer-production be evolutionary and sustainable?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The residency will bring together applicants of this open call with an invited group of experts from different fields.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Participants are invited to contribute with their own research and projects to the explorations and reflections about peer-production.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This thematic residency is developed in collaboration with the Swiss anthropologist Julien Vuilleumier.
  </p>
  
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    – The call is open to artists and practitioners from other fields, from Switzerland and from other places. – Participants will be selected by a jury of arts practitioners and experts from other fields.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    – The residency will take place from 7 to 14 April 2016 at Arc artist residency, in Romainmôtier, Switzerland.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    – The language of the residency will be English.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    – Besides the workshops and work space, Arc offers travel, accommodation and food for this thematic residency.
