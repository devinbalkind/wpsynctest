With only a couple of days to go before Spain’s decisive general elections, we share this note from author and 15-M activist [Luis Moreno-Caballud][1]

To our English speaking friends: I have the feeling that -as usual- very little good information is running around in English about what really is happening in Spain (please, correct me if I’m wrong). You know, we have a general election in 9 days, and for the first time, there’s a chance of kicking out of power the establishment parties that have pushed neoliberalism, austerity, and the rule of financial elites as the only political possibilities for decades. The option to beat them, <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/ahorapodemos/">Podemos</a>, is not perfect, but is what we collectively have managed to put together since 15M, in 2011. So, as much convinced as I am about the need for an everyday politics that changes our existence here and now, without having to wait to any electoral victory, I also think that this election is important, not just for Spain, and I think Podemos deserves the support of the international communities fighting against neoliberalism.

Will you show your support and share this? And, by the way, did you know that <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/ada.colau/">Ada Colau Ballano</a>, former housing movement activist, now mayor of Barcelona, has joined Podemos in coalition for this election? In the video you can see an interview with her on the day after she became mayor – also the video talks about the relations between 15M, Occupy Wall St., PAH, Podemos, etc…

With love and global solidarity, Sí se puede!!
