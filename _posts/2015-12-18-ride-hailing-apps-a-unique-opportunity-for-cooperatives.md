[Excerpted][1] from **Michal Rozworski**:

“Few technologies have as much potential for easy cooperative management as those of the currenly mislabelled sharing economy. These tools are not to blame. In fact, internet-based technologies are an opportunity for worker management. As Mike Konczal wrote in The Nation a year ago:

“*Given that the workers already own all the capital in the form of their cars, why aren’t they collecting all the profits? Worker cooperatives are difficult to start when there’s massive capital needed up front, or when it’s necessary to coordinate a lot of different types of workers… If any set of companies deserves to have its rentiers euthanized, it’s those of the ‘sharing economy’, in which management relies heavily on the individual ownership of capital, providing only coordination and branding*.”

Silicon Valley’s version of sharing means that while we carry the risks of illness, breakdown and everything else that comes with owning our tools – the cars that we drive for Uber or the computers we use for online Taskrabbit chores – they get to say how the gains from our services are distributed. The Luddites surely would be impressed that technology owners can now get rich simply by connecting people with each other. If looms and frames were the symbol for Luddites of their degradation, today’s drivers, couriers and taskrabbits can only point to ephemeral platforms and apps. While the Luddites attacked their bosses by destroying their looms and faced violent reprisals sanctioned by law, the privately-run digital networks of today are virtually impossible to physically disrupt while having the full force of the law behind them.

Instead of producing greater socialization that spreads wealth and decision-making, the sharing economy funnels money and control toward the top. Yet today’s world still has space for some pretty old-school demands the Luddites would recognize. They wanted to work less and have a say over how they worked (with technology!). We too could be using the fruits of technology to get ever-shorter workweeks, cooperate more and manage aspects of the economy together.

Faced wth the charge of techno-phobia, we must remember that the fight against Uber is a fight for a technology that could be used to distribute work more equally and foster genuine cooperation.:
