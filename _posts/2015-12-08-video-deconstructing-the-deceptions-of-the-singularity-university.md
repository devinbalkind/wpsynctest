> I will attempt to deconstruct Singularity University’s name, business model, strategic context, mission statement and accomplishments, organizational structure and their global plan. Singularity University’s Business Model in 5 words: **Create scarcity to sell abundance**. …And charge an arm and a leg for it…

**Nikolay Danaylov** deconstructs the claim of SU.

Worth watching and reading the full transcript [here][1].

The introduction reads:

“Singularity University is not about the singularity and is not even a university. It is not about abundance and is not an exponential organization.

Then what is Singularity University about?!

Those are the claims I made and the questions I asked, and tried to address, during my recent presentation at a local meetup organized by Singularity University in the Netherlands.”

**But here is the radical conclusion:**

“What is SU all about?!

Well, humor me with this absolutely crazy and totally outlandish hypothesis:

*Singularity University is a child of silicon valley. And silicon valley is about one thing: start a business, build it up and sell it. In other words Silicon Valley is about IPO’s. It is about taking companies public. And, the strategic drift that I have been getting based on all the observable changes and what’s been happening for the past few years is that Singularity University follows that mold and is being built up and groomed with the idea to eventually be sold to someone like Google, for example.*

So, ultimately, Singularity University is about selling to the highest bidder. Most likely Google.”
