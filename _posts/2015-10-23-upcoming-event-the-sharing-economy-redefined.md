<div class="session-summary">
<p>We’re pretty familiar with the sharing economy nowadays, with rapidly growing startups, legal cases and inventive business models grabbing headlines and propelling the concept to the mainstream.</p>
<p>But the sharing economy is more than just a few businesses from Silicon Valley. In this session, we’ll explore the diverse spectrum of this movement, from existing businesses trying to get a piece of the action to the distributed, local networks that are redefining communities around the world.</p>
<p>This shift is already having profound impacts, on people, resource and energy use, design and economics. How far does this disruption reach?</p>

<p><strong>Michel Bauwens</strong><br />
<strong>Founder and Director, P2P Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Michel Bauwens, theoretician, activist, and public speaker, is one of the pioneers of the peer-to-peer movement. He is founder and director of the P2P Foundation and works in collaboration with a global group of researchers in the exploration of peer productions, governance, and property. His work lays the conceptual foundations of a production system that would serve as an alternative to industrial capitalism.</p>
<p>In 2014, Bauwens was research director of the <a href="http://floksociety.org/" >floksociety.org</a> which produced the first integrated Commons Transition Plan for the government of Ecuador, in order to create policies for a ‘social knowledge economy’. In January 2015 <a href="http://commonstransition.org/" >CommonsTransition.org</a> was launched. Commons Transition builds on the work of the FLOK Society and features newly revised and updated, non-region specific versions of these policy documents.</p>
<p>His recent book &#8216;<em>Save the world &#8211; Towards a Post Capitalist Society with P2P</em>&#8216; is based on a series of interviews with Jean Lievens, originally published in Dutch, it has since been translated and published in French with an English language publication expected in the near future.</p>
