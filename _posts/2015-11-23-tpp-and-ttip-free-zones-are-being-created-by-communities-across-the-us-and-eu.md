Reposted from [Citizen Action Monitor][1], TPP-Free Zones are being created by communities across the US and EU.

#### Why aren’t Canada’s political, social, labour and environmental NGOs jumping all over this initiative?

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-11340 alignright" src="https://citizenactionmonitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/margaret-flowers.jpg?w=150&h=98" alt="Margaret Flowers" width="150" height="98" />][2]*“You can join communities that are rejecting these rigged corporate ‘trade’ deals that are being negotiated in secret and will undermine our ability to pass laws that protect public health and safety and the planet by organizing to create a TPP/TTIP-Free Zone. Details below.”* —**Margaret Flowers**

On a related note, [The Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund][3], a Pennsylvania-based NGO has, since 1995, been doing magnificent work with communities to establish ***Community Rights*** – such that communities are empowered to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their residents and the natural environment, and establish environmental and economic sustainability. They have worked at the local municipal level to establish Community Rights. Communities that have established Community Rights ordinances have faced legal challenges from corporate and states. In response, CELDF has recently begun building on grassroots organizing to drive change to the state level, bringing together communities from across states to build [State Community Rights Networks][4]. For more information, visit the CELDF website by clicking on the about linked name.

Returning to TPP-Free Zones, so far no Canadian communities appear on the world map of TPP-Free Zones. To access this map, click on the following linked title. The repost below includes a link to this map as well as all the other details and links to affiliated information sources.

### *[Communities Reject Rigged Trade, Create TPP/TTIP-Free Zones][5]* by Margaret Flowers, Popular Resistance, October 4, 2015

Note: You can join communities that are rejecting these rigged corporate ‘trade’ deals that are being negotiated in secret and will undermine our ability to pass laws that protect public health and safety and the planet by organizing to create a TPP/TTIP-Free Zone. Details below.

As negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) inch toward completion, resistance to it and the other rigged corporate international treaties, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Trade-in-Services Agreement (TiSA), is escalating.

*   A transAtlantic week of protests against the TPP and TTIP are planned from October 10 to 17. Visit [Trade4People.org][6] to learn more. Actions will be posted on [Flush the TPP][7].
*   There will be protests in Miami at the end of October during the next round of TTIP negotiations. Details are not yet confirmed, but they will be posted on the [Flush the TPP “Actions” page][7].
*   And during the APEC meetings in the Philippines in November, there will be protests in Manila and Washington, DC. [Click here][8] for information about the DC mobilization.

A powerful form of resistance is underway in communities across the United States and the European Union – people are passing resolutions opposing these ‘trade agreements,’ which are actually international treaties that should not be allowed to fast track through Congress, to create TPP and TTIP-free zones.

In the European Union, activists are working to pass 10,000 such resolutions. In collaboration with the public service union, Unison, [Global Justice Now][9], is providing helpful materials. Global Justice Now reports:

“It’s not just the UK. In [Austria][10], Germany, [France][11] and Belgium there are significant numbers of TTIP Free Zones being declared by local authorities. When EU and US negotiators in Brussels leave their meetings they immediately walk out into the Brussels municipality which is itself a TTIP Free Zone.

There are [39 ‘no TTIP’ councils in Spain][12] and a good covering in Northern Italy. This is a Europe-wide movement of local resistance to the corporate power grab that TTIP represents.”

During the fight to stop Congress from passing Fast Track legislation that will be used to rush these agreements through Congress, cities from Seattle, WA to Madison, WI to New York, NY passed resolutions against Fast Track. Labor played a big part in making these successful. Now, new resolutions are underway in more cities with the goal of 100.

On October 8, a resolution will be voted upon in Miami, FL, potentially making it a TPP/TTIP-Free Zone before the next round of TTIP negotiations there. [Click here for details][13].

Organizing a TPP/TTIP-Free Zone is a great way to raise awareness of the ways that these secret rigged corporate deals will directly impact our communities. From the prohibition of “Buy America” practices to the new powers for corporations to sue over public health and safety laws that interfere with their profits to the outsourcing of jobs, lowering of wages, reduction of food safety and raising the costs of health care, the TPP and TTIP place corporate profits over protection of people and the planet.

**Here is more information on [how to create a TPP/TTIP-Free Zone][14] from the Alliance for Democracy:**

**“If you, our un-elected representatives, create this corporate-driven monstrosity and then go to Congress for a rubber stamp, WE WILL NOT OBEY.”**

**Which cities have gone TPP/TTIP/TiSA Free?**

**[This map][15]** shows which US cities and counties have passed TPP Free Zone ordinances or resolutions against Fast Track, TPP or other pending trade pacts like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA).

It is time to make our municipalities **“TPP Free Zones,”** following in the footsteps of the successful resistance to an earlier trade agreement, the [Multilateral Agreement on Investment][16], which was defeated in 1998 thanks to a global grassroots campaign.

*   Click **[here][20]** for some pointers in getting a **TPP Free Zone** law passed.

**What is a TPP-Free Zone?**

AfD Co-Chair Ruth Caplan explains how local organizing for “TPP-Free Zone” laws can help defeat this so-called “free trade” agreement while supporting global civil society movements for economic and environmental justice and local democracy.
