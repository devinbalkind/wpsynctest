The coming together of commons-oriented projects seems to be intensifying.  Even as the <a href="http://www.bollier.org/blog/le-temps-des-communes-biggest-commons-festival-ever">Le Temps des Communes festival</a> in dozens of Francophone cities convenes thousands of commoners, an organizing meeting for a Chicago Chamber of Commons in planned for Saturday, October 10. (You can register for the event <a href="http://www.ica-usa.org/events/event_details.asp?id=678247">here</a>.)

This idea has been kicking around for a while – see<a href="http://bollier.org/blog/it%E2%80%99s-time-start-chamber-commons"> this 2013 blog post</a>  – but it seems that the folks in Chicago are serious about making it work. They want to foster deeper collaboration among the many groups focused on shared ownership, the collaborative economy, co-operatives and other mutual-benefit initiatives. The organizers say they want to “connect social entrepreneurs, L3C’s, B-Corps and other enterprises focused on triple bottom line, sharing-economy approaches to commerce and community development.” People involved with economic transformation, environmental protection, community life and culture are also invited.

The day will start with a consensus workshop that will try to come up with a shared definition of the commons. This will be followed with discussions for startup plans for a Chicago Commons, which organizers hope will be the first of many Chambers of Commons across the nation and globe.

In May, Huffington Post writer Sally Duros wrote <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sally-duros/chamber-of-commons-points_b_7199382.html">a piece</a> about the envisioned Chamber of Commerce in which she quoted Michel Bauwens, founder of the P2P Foundation:
<blockquote>“The old way is this. Here’s a problem. We need resources to solve that problem. We create a hierarchy to direct resources at the problem,” Bauwens says.

“Here’s another way. There are enough people in the world with time, skills and energy who would be willing to work to solve that problem. The new solution is to create a commons and a platform that allows people to self-aggregate and collaborate to solve that problem.”</blockquote>
Here’s hoping that the organizing meeting is productive!
