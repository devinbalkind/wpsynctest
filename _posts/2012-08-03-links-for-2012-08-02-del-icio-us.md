  The W3c Identity in the Browser Workshop is currently being held in Menlo Park, California, in the Mozilla buildings. The agenda is packed with short talks and discussions with a very strict focus of identity as it relates to browsers and the web.</li>

  Real leadership is about transforming the system, not just succeeding within or despite the system. We know how to run organizations in ways that that lift up the human spirit, both for those doing the work and those for whom the work is done. In last week&rsquo;s article I suggested that we get on with it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dsw-online.org/news/news-view/display/recampaign-in-berlin.html?no_cache=1">DSW (Deutsche Stiftung Weltbev&ouml;lkerung): re:campaign in Berlin</a><br>
  Berlin, May: From workshops to informal talks, speed meetings to networking, the re:campaign social media event in Berlin had something for everyone. The event kicked off on Friday 11th May with a talk from Dr. Duncan Green who is Head of Research at Oxfam UK. Dr. Green gave an inspiring talk about how people can overcome poverty using ICT for development. This was followed by a talk from Elizabeth McGuane, lead Content Strategist for LBi London. After lunch, participants broke off into various workshops which lasted until well into the evening.</li>

  That is our problem: our unquestioning attachment to Milton Friedman&rsquo;s foundational assumption that shareholder value is a corporation&rsquo;s only (or at least primary) responsibility. It no longer works. (I realize that for the economically indoctrinated, and that includes most of us, this assertion amounts to a kind of heresy. But all great truths, we are told, begin as heresies.)
  
  So, if that is the problem, what is the answer? First of all, the answer doesn&rsquo;t deny the need to make a profit</li>
