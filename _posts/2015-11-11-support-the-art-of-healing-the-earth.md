        Teaching the <b>basic relationships between ecological health and human wellbeing</b> has been central to our mission and can be seen as a continuing thread in many of our films such as<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjNDiBCb-mE" rel="nofollow"> “Lessons of the Loess Plateau”</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEmHDFxKqaw" rel="nofollow">“Hope in a Changing Climate”</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBLZmwlPa8A" rel="nofollow">“Green Gold”</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9dXtW8VjfM" rel="nofollow">“Forests of Hope”</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uN2b1syMsA" rel="nofollow">“The Promise of the Commons”</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4ed_EhtmJs" rel="nofollow">“Healing the Earth and the Human Spirit”</a> and others.

        Help us Make Effective Television Programs and Provide Them to Audiences Worldwide for Free!<b> </b>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        We work for you and people all over the world because we believe that everyone needs and deserves access to the same information on the environment and ecology. We don’t believe that knowledge is a commodity we believe it is a right. Because we make our programs available to educators, students and the public all over the world without charge we need your help.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        With your support we can bear the financial costs for the necessary technical equipment, logistical planing and for contracting <b>the most talented artists to help us </b>in this endeavor. <b>We are making an amazing, life-changing series of films on how to create jobs, support families and communities by restoring natural ecological function. </b>You can help us make those films, translate them into many languages and allow them to be seen around the world.

      </h2>
      
      <p>
        With your help we will also be able to create a sophisticated platform to share our extensive library. In 20 years we have built an <b>enormous archive of images from all continents</b> to help <b>educators, students and the general public</b> to better understand what we are collectively facing at this time and <b>what each individual and all of us together can do:</b> be the change we want to see in the world.

        <i>The EEMP is best known for the documentation of the Loess Plateau restoration in China which has led to scientific, policy and physical changes in several countries and holds important solutions to Climate Change.</i>
