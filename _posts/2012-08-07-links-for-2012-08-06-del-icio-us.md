  It's been more than a year since the Aaron Swartz indictment was announced (disclosure: I know him socially, and have admired his work). The court case has fallen out of the news now. But it hasn't been dropped or plea-bargained. It's still slowly and agonizingly grinding through the legal system. I've been following it via the court filings, out of personal interest in situations where programmers get sued for electronic activism.
  
  Basically, Judge Learned Hand was right about lawsuits, they are dreadful. On and on the filing go, a slow-motion battle that is part war of attrition, part trial by ordeal before trial by jury. It appears that Aaron Swartz is fortunate enough to be able to mount a first-class defense, so his lawyers can challenge various evidence that the prosecution wants to introduce.</li>

  Every single one of us holds the key to power - debt. Just as coal miners in England used their access to coal to flip the balance of power, so debtors can use their access to credit by declaring a 'debt strike', to force a revaluation of the bank stranglehold on the economy.&nbsp;</li>

  The Bush 6 constituted a legal team which authorized torture at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba and elsewhere. One might think, on the surface at least, that the incoming Obama administration would want to bring these figures to justice. However, WikiLeaks cables reveal to the contrary that Obama officials pressured to have Garz&oacute;n removed from the Bush 6 case, which was ultimately dismissed.
  
  If that was not bad enough, cables also reveal that the U.S. pressured the Spanish government to have Garz&oacute;n drop his investigation into the death of a Spanish journalist who was killed by US shelling in Baghdad. Moreover, Garz&oacute;n was obliged to abandon efforts to get to the bottom of allegations made by Spanish Guant&aacute;namo detainees that they had been tortured.</li>

  Call me Wildstreak/Sweetwater. I was asked to share the story of how online gaming addiction has affected my son, but I realized I can&rsquo;t share that honestly without causing harm. I can&rsquo;t offer a happy ending, a nice wrap-up with everyone leading nice, well-adjusted lives. I don&rsquo;t have a solution to the crisis or a way to repair the damage that online gaming addiction has wreaked in my own family.
  
  What I can offer is a better understanding of online gaming addiction and its spiritual effects on the players</li>

  Sixteen girls straggle in, a few at a time, from a long morning of poignant and difficult conversation. They are greeted by house mothers who seem to know exactly who needs a hug at this precise moment. The girls themselves exchange tears and laughter. And even amid obvious wrestling with what they have just shared and witnessed in dialogue, a tender affection fills the air. Music comes on. A few girls set about doing chores. In the living room, three take turns with a hula hoop. In the bedroom next door, several sing along as one plays guitar. Each girl makes a point of thanking me and my colleague&mdash;the volunteers who brought them lunch this day.</li>

  It will not do merely to complain about the widespread and outrageous&nbsp;invasions of privacy that citizens of the developed world constantly suffer, nor to legislate against them one by one. If we really want to fix the privacy problem, we have to identify the underlying shift in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards what it means to be a person.</li>
