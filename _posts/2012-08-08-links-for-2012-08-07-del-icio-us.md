  As an anthropologist who studies the daily work and global technologies of financial traders, I have always resisted this comparison. Thousands of dealers trade in capital markets, each with their own strategies and time frames in mind. The system does not necessarily set their interests against each other directly. More importantly, moralizing often obstructs analysis. If we are to understand the Street&rsquo;s working beliefs about risk and markets, we should hold our own judgments in abeyance&mdash;at least until we learn how financial trading works. Those interested in political engagement will be far more effective once they develop an accurate picture of what Wall Streeters think they are doing.</li>
