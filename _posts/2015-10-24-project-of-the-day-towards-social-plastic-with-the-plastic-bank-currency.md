<p>Interesting recycling project:</p>
<p>&#8220;The <a href="http://plasticbank.org/">Plastic Bank</a> is turning plastic waste into a currency that can be exchanged to help lift people out of poverty &#038; transition them into a self-sustaining life of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>We are setting up re-purposing / exchange centers for plastic waste in area that have high concentration of poverty and plastic pollution. Our mandate is to provide a ladder of opportunity for the world&#8217;s poor to ascend from poverty by providing access to education, opportunities and 3D printing services. The exchange process for our recycled “Social Plastic” improves the life of a disadvantaged person while cleaning our planet.</p>
<p>Our goal is to lead the movement towards worldwide demand for the use of Social Plastic in everyday products. The higher the worldwide demand becomes, the higher the reward will be for harvesting Social Plastic.&#8221;</p>
